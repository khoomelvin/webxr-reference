# Lifetime of an AR/VR Web Application

The lifetime of an AR/VR web application is generally as follows.

1. Request a _device_ through the API.
1. If a device is available, do one of two things.
   * For an _immersive session_, advertise the AR/VR functionality to the viewer and prompt the user to enter AR/VR. If the user accepts use the _user gesture_ to request a _session_.
   * For a _non-immersive_ session simply request the session.
1. Create a _graphics layer_ to provide bitmap images to the device.
1. Use the session to run a _render loop_, which produces graphical _frames_ and displays them to the device.
1. For each frame loop through its _views_ and draw content to them.
1. Repeat the render loop until the user decides to exit AR/VR.

Let's look at each step in detail.

**Note:** The code in this article is based on demos found in the [Immersive Web WebXR Samples](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr-samples/).

## Request a device

The WebXR Device API added the [XR](xr) interface to the `navigator` object. Use this to do both feature detection and requesting a device. The code below demonstrates this with a few necessary elaborations.

Notice that `XR.requestDevice()` returns a promise that resolves with an `XRDevice` object or rejects with a `NotFoundError`. Another possibility is `NotAllowedError`, which occurs when device permissions have not been granted. See [Requesting Device Permissions](permissions) for more information.

```javascript
if (navigator.xr) {
  navigator.xr.requestDevice()
  .then(xrDevice => {
    // Advertise the AR/VR functionality to get a user gesture.
  })
  .catch(err => {
    if (err.name === 'NotFoundError') {
      console.error('No XR devices available:', err);
    } else if (err.name === 'NotAllowedError') {
      // Permissions have not been granted.
      // Trigger permission flow.
    } else {
      console.error('Requesting XR device failed:', err);
    }
  })
} else{
  console.log("This browser does not support the WebXR API.");
}
```

## For an Immersive Session, Get a User Gesture

For an immersive session entering AR/VR requires a user gesture. Start by defining session options, which includes both the type of session and a presentation context, which is actually the `HTMLCanvasElement` where AR/VR content will be displayed.

The example below shows this. Note that when calling `getContext()` you must pass the `'xrpresent'` keyword, which is new with the WebXR specification.

```javascript
xrPresentationContext = htmlCanvasElement.getContext('xrpresent');
let sessionOptions = {
  immersive: true,
  outputContext: xrPresentationContext
}
```

Call `supportsSession()` with your chosen session options. If it succeeds, use the returned promise to display or enable a control for entering VR. The example below does this by flipping a button's display from `"none"` to `"block"`.

```javascript
xrDevice.supportsSession(sessionOptions)
.then(()) => {
  // Make the button visible by changing "none" to "block".
  button.style.display = "block";
})
.catch(err => {
  logger.error("AR/VR session could not be created. ", err);
})
```

Use the displayed control's event handler to call `requestSession()`. It returns a promise that resolves with an `XRSession` object.

```javascript
button.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
  xrDevice.requestSession(sessionOptions)
  .then(xrSession => {
    // Initialize the render loop.
    // Add 'select' event handlers to process input.
  });
})
```

**Note:** For information on using the `select` event handlers, see [Interacting with Input Devices](devices).

## Or, Just Get a Non-immersive Session

If you're using a non-immersive session, also called a "magic window", getting a session is much simpler. As before, you need a context and a session options object.

```javascript
xrPresentationContext = htmlCanvasElement.getContext('xrpresent');
let sessionOptions = {
  // The immersive option is optional for non-immersive sessions; the value
  //   defaults to false.
  immersive: false,
  outputContext: xrPresentationContext
}
```

This time you can skip the user gesture and go straight to requesting the session.

```javascript
xrDevice.requestSession(sessionOptions)
.then(xrSession => {
  // Create a graphics layer and initialize the render loop.
  // Add 'select' event handlers to process input.
})
```

**Note:** For information on using the `select` event handlers, see [Interacting with Input Devices](devices).

## Create a Graphics Layer

Note: The demos that the sample code is drawn from rely on WebGL. To avoid turning this into a WebGL tutorial, it will use [Cottontail](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-samples/tree/master/js/cottontail), a simple WebGL framework used in the [samples from the Immersive Web Community Group](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-samples). This is also not a tutorial on Cottontail, so it may gloss over things for the benefit of focusing on WebXR.

Presenting AR or VR to a viewer requires a source of bitmaps. This source of bitmaps must be supplied by one of the `XRLayer` interface's subtypes. The code below uses an `XRWebGLLayer` subtype (which is the only one supported in the first version of the WebXR specification).

As stated, this code relies heavily on Cottontail. The actual creation of the bitmap source, as far as WebXR is concerned is near the bottom. The sessions base layer gets an instance of `XRWebGLLayer`.

```javascript
// Do some Cottontail stuff.
let scene = new Scene();
scene.addNode(new CubeSea());

xrDevice.requestSession(sessionOptions)
.then(session => {
  // Use Cottontail's createWebGLContext() method.
  gl = createWebGLContext({
    // It needs an instance of XRDevice.
    compatibleXRDevice: session.device
  });
  // Use Cottontail's Renderer object.
  renderer = new Renderer(gl);
  scene.setRenderer(renderer);
  session.baseLayer = new XRWebGLLayer(session, gl);

  // Initialize the render loop.
})
```

## Start the Render loop

Before you can start the render loop you need an `XRFrameOfReference` object which describes the space or stage in which AR/VR content will be created. There are different types, so type must be specified when calling `requestFrameOfReference()`. (See "Frame of Reference Types" above.) This function returns a promise that resolves with an <a href="xrframeofreference">XRFrameOfReference</a> object. If and only if the promise resolves you call `requestAnimationFrame()` to start the render loop.

This function takes a callback function, which is defined separately instead of as a lamda in `requestAnimationFrame()`. This is because it needs to be called repeatedly while the render loop runs.

Notice also that the `XRFrameOfReference` object is stored in a variable that's broader than the scope of the promise that returns it. Other functions require a reference to this object. Make sure it's scope is high enough to be accessible from whatever function needs it.

```javascript
let xrFrameOfRef = null;

xrDevice.requestSession(sessionOptions)
.then(session => {
  // Set up Cottontail and get an XRWebGLLayer.

  session.requestFrameOfReference('eyeLevel')
  .then(frameOfRef => {
    xrFrameOfRef = frameOfRef;
    session.requestAnimationFrame(onFrame)
  })
})

function onFrame(time, frame) {
  // Continue the render loop.
}
```

## The Render Loop

Conceptually the render loop is pretty simple.

1. Request an animation frame.
1. In the animation frame get an <a href="xrdevicepose">XRDevicePose</a> object.
1. Loop through it's <a href="xrview">XRView</a> objects, and draw a scene to each view.
1. repeat until the viewer choses to quit.

Where it gets complex, is with the drawing of graphics to the views. As stated before, that complexity is outside the scope of this article.

The code below shows the basic structure excluding any graphics work. This code is not usable as is. It's intended to make the render loop easier to understand. We'll add graphic drawing code later.

```javascript
session.requestAnimationFrame(onFrame);

function onFrame(time, xrFrameOfRef) {
  let pose = frame.getDevicePose(xrFrameOfRef);
  if (pose) {
    for (let view of frame.views) {
      scene.draw(view.projectionMatrix, pose.getViewMatrix(view))
    }
  }
  frame.session.requestAnimationFrame(onFrame);
  // Update the position of any input sources.
}
```

There are a few things to call out. First, as of May 2018 the callback's time argument has not yet been implemented.

You should always check that pose did not return `null`. There are a number of reasons this might happen and testing for it prevents later code from throwing exceptions. (See Recovering from a null Poses for details.)

Notice the recursive call to `requestAnimationFrame()`. This is how you initiate the next iteration of the render loop. It can occur anywhere inside the frame callback.

The example above also marks the location where you would update the position of the input devices. See [Interacting with Input Devices](devices) for more information.

If I add the graphics rendering from the sample, the code looks like this.

```javascript
function onFrame(time, xrFrameOfRef) {
  let session = frame.session;
  let layer = new XRWebGLLayer(session, gl);
  scene.startFrame();
  gl.bindFramebuffer(gl.FRAMEBUFFER, session.baseLayer.framebuffer);
  gl.clear(gl.COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | gl.DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
  let pose = frame.getDevicePose(xrFrameOfRef);
  if (pose) {
    for (let view of frame.views) {
      let viewport = layer.getViewport(session.baseLayer);
      gl.viewport(viewport.x, viewport.y,
                  viewport.width, viewport.height);
      scene.draw(view.projectionMatrix, pose.getViewMatrix(view));
    }
  }
  frame.session.requestAnimationFrame(onFrame);
  scene.endFrame();
}
```

## Exit VR


An XR session may end for several reasons, including ending by your own code through a call to `XRSession.end()`. Other causes include the headset being disconnected or another application taking control of it. This is why a well-behaved application should monitor the end event and when it occurs, discard the session and renderer objects. An XR session once ended cannot be resumed.

To monitor the `end` event, add a handler for it at the very begging of a session.

```javascript
xrDevice.requestSession(sessionOptions)
.then(xrSession => {
  // Create a WebGL layer and initialize the render loop.
  xrSession.addEventListener('end', onSessionEnd);
});
```

You also need to provide a button or some other type of affordance to allow users to end a session deliberately.

```javascript
button.addEventListener('click', () => {
  xrSession.end();
})
```

The `onend` event handler has to do several things including setting the `xrSession` to null and possibly passing rendering to the window's `requestAnimationFrame()` function.

```javascript
// Restore the page to normal after immersive access has been released.
function onSessionEnd() {
  xrSession = null;

  // Ending the session stops executing callbacks passed to the XRSession's
  // requestAnimationFrame(). If you need to continue rendering, use the
  // window's requestAnimationFrame() function.
  window.requestAnimationFrame(onDrawFrame);
}
```
